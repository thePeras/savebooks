# savebooks
It's an extension to save readed or to read books.
I will try to use Firebase for authentication with google auth and it's database.
For search books will be used the google books API.
When some image is drag in the active tab will be executing the following algoritm
    - analize text in the image, with some google API
    - search books with some title and artist in the text
    - If the text both includes artist and title of a know book, open the extension popup

Other feraute: download books in
